# ESP32-CAM-Image-Recognition-With-a-TinyML-for-Microcontroller-or-ML-with-API
This is a Repository that it contends the core to use ESP32-CAM with a Machine Learning Neural Network using at the first one TinyML architecture, the second architecture is used with an API to use all capacity to process the images without the necesity to import the model to Arduino with TFlite
